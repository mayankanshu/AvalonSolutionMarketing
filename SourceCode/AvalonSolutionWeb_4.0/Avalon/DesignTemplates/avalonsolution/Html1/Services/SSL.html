                <h4>What is a SSL Certificate? </h4>
                <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites for the protection of their online transactions with their customers. </p>

                <!--<h4>Why do you Need SSL Certificate on your Website?</h4>
                <p>When accepting payments online you will be asking your customers to transmit very sensitive information across the Web. By its nature the Internet is not secure. Anything transmitted is sent as plain text and can be read by anyone who intercepts the message at any point during the transmission. </p>-->

                <p>Also customers are getting smart about online security. Although most users do not understand the technical aspects of how the Internet works, they do know that their information needs to be protected at all times. More and more of them are looking for the padlock icon and “https” prefix in the address bar of their browser or security provider’s seal on the web page before submitting personal information online. By contrast, if a user attempts to submit personal information to an unsecured Website (i.e., a website that is not protected with a valid SSL Certificate), the browser's built-in security mechanism triggers a warning to the customer, reminding them that the site is not secure and that sensitive data might be intercepted by third parties. Faced with such a warning, most Internet users will likely look elsewhere to make a purchase. Also Pay with Amazon, PayPal and other Integrated Payment Methods require SSL Certificate on your Website compulsorily to process online transactions. </p>
                <p><img src="{$P.AvalonDesignTemplagePath}images/SslYourDomainName.gif" alt=""> <br>All ECommerce Websites on the Internet must have an SSL Certificate to ensure safe credit card transactions through the website. Gaining the trust of online customers is vital for the success of ECommerce. Make sure your Website earns its full potential by increasing customer confidence at transaction time. </p>
