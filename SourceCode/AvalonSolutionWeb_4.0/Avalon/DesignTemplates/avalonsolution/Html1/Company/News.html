                                    New York, NY &mdash; Avalon Solution has recently integrated Amazon Payments option in its Ecommerce Solutions. Now retailers can add <b>Pay with Amazon </b>as a Payment Method on their Websites to make their checkout process simpler and seamless.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Millions of Amazon buyers</b> can login and pay on your website or mobile site with the information already stored in their Amazon account. It's fast, easy and secure and helps you add new customers, increase sales, and reduce fraud costs.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This allows online retailers to create long-term relationships with more customers. Pay with Amazon helps replace guest checkouts with recognized customers, leading to improved services which include: managing and tracking orders, purchase history detail, special discounts, instant access to shipping addresses and payment methods.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With Amazon Payments, website visitors can avoid account signup and use their Amazon Account to buy products available on your website. When a Website Visitor clicks on Amazon Payment Method, a Login Popup Window appears and once they enter their Amazon.com Login, they can use their Amazon Account Information to complete purchases.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Website visitors want the advantage of creating an account to save purchase preferences when shopping online, but the majority are bothered by the hassle of registering on a website. Increasingly, they choose to shop on sites that offer seamless online payment options to take advantage of stored information. That is why Amazon has introduced this payment solution where buyers can pay on any participating site using their Amazon credentials.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    When your Website Visitors select Pay with Amazon option, they can use the information stored in their Amazon account to pay conveniently. Pay with Amazon offers Safe and Seamless Online Shopping with many benefits:

                                    <strong>World Has Gone Online!</strong> While a website will not replace the jewelry
                                    retail brick and mortar store, it is an important tool for showcasing what jewelers
                                    have to offer 24/7. Study after study has shown that e-Commerce has continued to
                                    explode in the last few years, despite the struggling economy. Diamonds and jewelry,
                                    in particular, have been a major category for online retailers as consumers are
                                    researching and buying billions of dollars worth of diamonds and jewelry online.

                                    and convenience from retailers, it has become imperative for traditional jewelry
                                    stores to have a strong web presence. That’s where Avalon Solution - a leading B2C

                                    create, manage and track e-mail marketing campaigns. Attractive and professional

                                    E-mail campaigns require less time, money and resources than with any other traditional
                                    marketing channels such as direct mail, print advertising and TV commercials. According
                                    to research conducted by the Direct Marketing Association, e-mail marketing generated
                                    an ROI of $43.62 for every dollar spent in 2009. As such, it outperforms all the
                                    other direct marketing channels. It is a highly effective way to increase sales,
                                    drive website or store traffic and develop loyalty.

                                    store and website invitations, new product and collection introductions, birthdays

                                    With more and more consumers turning to SmartPhones to search for the best deals
                                    on products and services, it has become imperative for retailers to have a vital,
                                    Mobile Ready Website to reach these consumers and remain competitive. Furthermore,
                                    it’s not sufficient to simply create a miniature version of your website for mobile
                                    applications. Consumers don’t relate to their mobile phones the same way they relate
                                    to their laptop and desktop computers &ndash; and accessing desktop websites from a mobile
                                    phone can be slow and frustrating, because desktop websites were not designed for
                                    SmartPhones. Through Avalon Solution, you can reach and retain these mobile consumers
                                    with a state-of-the-art, Mobile Ready Website at very little cost.

                                    NEW YORK, NY (MAY 20, 2010) &mdash; The World Has Gone Online! While a website will not
                                    replace the jewelry retail brick and mortar store, it is an important tool for showcasing
                                    what jewelers have to offer 24/7! Study after study has shown that ECommerce has
                                    continued to explode in the last few years, despite the struggling economy. In fact,
                                    according to Forrester Research’s prestigious US ECommerce Forecast, Online Sales
                                    in 2010 could reach $177 billion, representing a 13% growth. Diamonds and Jewelry,
                                    in particular, have been a major category for online retailers as consumers are
                                    researching and buying billions of dollars worth of diamonds and jewelry online.
                                    According to ComScore’s report, Jewelry &amp; Watches ranked as the top performing online
                                    retail category for the 2009 holiday season growing 20 percent versus a year ago.
                                    As consumer-shopping habits have shifted towards demanding 24-7 availability, flexibility
                                    and convenience from retailers, it has become imperative for traditional jewelry
                                    stores to have a strong Web presence. That’s where <strong>Avalon Solution</strong>
                                    comes in.

                                    developers to building my own, but the maintenance always stopped me cold … Thankfully,
                                    Avalon Solution came along, I signed up, and now I have a professional Web site
                                    that is actually functional, updated and impressive … Coupled with the fact that
                                    it is spearheaded by one of my vendors is the icing on the cake. Thank you so much
                                    for having the vision and understanding of what I need as an independent jeweler."

                                    I was very surprised how many people went on the site and came in with a printout
                                    of what they wanted for Christmas. The Wish List feature makes the sale for you!
                                    It also is very easy to customize the site (adding upcoming events and promotions,

                                Most retailers know the importance of establishing an online presence, but simply
                                don’t have the time or resources to make it happen. Until now only a handful of
                                companies specializing in the jewelry industry were available to help. Avalon Solution
                                is an innovative website development company specializing in fine jewelry needs.
                                They take care of everything, including back end maintenance and customer support.

                                    don’t have to spend time, energy and money figuring out how to create, host, maintain
                                    and update their site. They do it for you, plus so much more.

                                    Each website created by Avalon Solution is backed by the latest and most reliable

                                    such as Google Maps, Google Voice and YouTube for TV Commercials. Google Analytics
                                    is built into every website to enable store owners to track the geographic location
                                    and time of their customers’ browsing activity.

                                    For retailers Avalon Solution’s ability to partner with well-known software and
                                    application providers translates into exceptional website quality with nearly 100%
                                    reliability. For jewelry consumers it means 24/7 access to your products.

                                    But the jewelry industry has unique web challenges all to itself. Having a website
                                    with some do-it-yourself photographs of your products could do more harm than good
                                    if the quality is poor. And we all know photographing and retouching jewelry is
                                    difficult. That’s why Avalon Solution has partnered with Ashi Diamonds, and soon
                                    many other leading manufacturers, to obtain high quality, multiple views of product
                                    images and detailed style descriptions, taking the burden off the retailer to provide
                                    them with ready to sell products on their website.

                                    "We understand the two most important components of a successful website are high
                                    quality images and product content, after technology. That’s why we’ve partnered
                                    with Ashi and other vendors to provide product images and style details for retailers
                                    who carry their line," comments Rajeev Pandya, Partner of Avalon Solution.

                                    With 92.5% of adults citing that they regularly or occasionally research products
                                    online before buying, today’s retail jeweler is missing a boat load of potential
                                    clients if they don’t have a presence on the web. According to the US Department
                                    of Commerce, 2007 US online jewelry sales were roughly $5 billion - $5 BILLION!
                                    Company websites are no longer an ‘extra,’ they are a necessity.

                                    "We really understand the constraints on the jeweler’s time," states Neelesh Ghoshalkar,
                                    CTO of Avalon Solution. "Most retailers aren’t able to invest time and money into
                                    getting their site up and running, much less being able to take care of the maintenance
                                    on the back end. We’ve spent the last two years in beta testing making sure what
                                    we’re offering retailers is useful and applicable. Avalon Solution has been customized
                                    by fine jewelry retailers across the country to meet the needs of every retailer."

                                    And they listened to their more than 100 beta test users and incorporated their
                                    suggestions. The Avalon Solution of today looks very different than the original.
                                    Adding features like secure shopping cart, product upload, template customization,
                                    ability to create and customize pages, along with branded digital flash E-Catalogs
                                    makes it easier for retailers to get exactly what they want from their website.
                                    And they’ve managed to offer these basic features for as little at $2,995.

                                    Avalon Solution has also partnered with Rapaport to offer Diamond Search, a search
                                    program utilizing RapNet’s Diamond Feed. RapNet is Rapaport’s Diamond Trading Network
                                    connecting thousands of the best diamond suppliers and buyers around the world.
                                    Retailers will designate the diamond specifications they want to carry and customers
                                    who are searching for loose stones will be able to view them from their website.
                                    If the client requests to view the diamond in store, the retailer can retain the
                                    diamond on memo from their preferred vendors.

                                    And, soon to come, the company will add a promotional e-mail module allowing retailers
                                    to design and send out e-blasts that remind customers of important dates as well
                                    as inform them of special product promotions, all from their website. But the company
                                    won’t stop there. They will be continuously improving their e-commerce solution
                                    to provide their customers with the latest technology, website design and jewelry
                                    fashion.

                                    Because they’ve done their research Avalon Solution understands that many retailers
                                    aren’t looking to pick up new customers across the country. Instead, retailers want
                                    to be included in regional searches that encompass a hundred mile radius or less.
                                    They can make that happen through their Search Optimization, Title Tags and Keywords
                                    customization built into the website’s administration. Not to mention their team
                                    of over 30 professionals specializing in website programming, digital imaging, content
                                    development, graphic design, testing and support.

                                        of what they wanted for Christmas. The Wish List feature makes the sale for you!
                                        It also is very easy to customize the site. I am looking forward to using this long
                                        overdue sales tool to help my business grow."

                                    NEW YORK, NY (July 17, 2008) &mdash; Study after study has shown that ECommerce has continued
                                    to explode in the last few years, despite the struggling economy. In fact, according
                                    to Shop.org’s prestigious State of Retailing Online annual report, online retail
                                    sales are expected to increase by 17% to $204 billion in 2008. Diamonds and jewelry,
                                    in particular, have been a major category for online retailers. Not only are consumers
                                    buying billions of dollars worth of diamonds and jewelry online; they also are using
                                    the Internet to "pre-shop" and educate themselves before making both online and
                                    in-store purchases. As consumer-shopping habits have shifted toward demanding 24-7
                                    availability, flexibility and convenience from retailers, it has become imperative
                                    for traditional jewelry stores to have a strong Web presence. That’s where Avalon
                                    Solution comes in.

                                    "I’ve tried several different ways to produce an ongoing Web site, from hiring high-paid
                                    developers to building my own, but the maintenance always stopped me cold … Thankfully,
                                    Avalon Solution came along, I signed up, and now I have a professional Web site
                                    that is actually functional, updated and impressive … Coupled with the fact that
                                    it is spearheaded by one of my vendors is the icing on the cake. Thank you so much
                                    for having the vision and understanding of what I need as an independent jeweler."

                                    continual updating and improvement to the Web site. It keeps an updated bridal catalog
                                    and sales flyer on the site. It also provides links to our designer collections

                                    I was very surprised how many people went on the site and came in with a printout
                                    of what they wanted for Christmas. The Wish List feature makes the sale for you!
                                    It also is very easy to customize the site (adding upcoming events and promotions,
                                    etc.) I am looking forward to using this long overdue (for me) sales tool to help
