                <h4>Why HTTPS?</h4>
                <p>You&#39;ve probably heard about this, but weren’t sure what it is. </p>
                <p>Google wants your website to run using the <strong>Secure HTTPS</strong> Protocol rather than the common unsecure HTTP Protocol. Why, because HTTPS encryption protects the channel between your customers and your website, ensuring no one in the middle can tamper with the traffic or spy on sensitive data like payment information flowing through the channels. Without this encryption, it&#39;s easy for hackers &amp; other busybodies to intercept information sent from your customers computers to your websites or inject malware into your customers computer.</p>
                <p>If your website doesn’t run on Secure HTTPS Protocol, visitors will see a <b class="text-danger">&quot;Not Secure&quot;</b> warning while browsing your website. This could have the effect of scaring away your site visitors and raising your bounce rate metrics. You can imagine how badly this could affect your eCommerce sales and demolish your websites reputation among your customers.</p>

                <h4>What can I do about this?</h4>
