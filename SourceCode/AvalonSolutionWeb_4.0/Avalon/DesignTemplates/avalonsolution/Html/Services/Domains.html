                <p>Creating and registering the right domain name is one of the central elements in building your online presence. You should select a domain name that distinguishes your jewelry business from others that already exist on the World Wide Web and allow online users to find your website quickly and easily. The shorter the site name, the easier it is for a customer to type and most importantly, remember. </p>

                <p>If you have an Existing Domain Name, we can use this to set up your Store’s Website. However, we will require temporary access to your Domain Control Panel so that we can properly configure your DNS & MX Records to point to your Store’s Website hosted on Avalon Solution Servers on Codero and to properly integrate Google Apps and Google Analytics on your New Website. If you have an Existing Domain Name, you can give us access to your Domain Control Panel by following ways: </p>
                <p>If you have an Existing Domain Name, you can give us access to your Domain Control Panel by following ways: </p>

                <h4> 1. You Can Email Us Your User Login and Password </h4>
                <p>We need this information till we complete the setup of your Website. After all technical formalities are completed and your Website is setup, you can update your login password. This is the simplest method and gives us immediate access to your Domain Control Panel. </p>

                <h4> 2. You Can Give Us Executive Access or Authority To Your Domain Control Panel </h4>
                <p>This authorization is done by you through your Domain Control Panel and it involves sending us an email with a link and authorization code to access your Domain Control Panel. Upon activation of the email from our end, you will then need to re-confirm and approve the access. Please see your Domain Name Registrar help instructions on how to do this. This method is of medium complexity and takes about 1-3 days to give us access to your Domain Control Panel. </p>

                <h4>3. You Can Transfer Your Domain Name to Avalon Solution</h4>
                <p>You will always retain legal ownership of your domain name and it remains your property. We will set up an account for you with Avalon Solution and after all setup is completed, we will transfer your login name and password of this account back to you. You need to send your Authorization Code associated with your Current Domain Name so that we can transfer your Domain Name to Avalon Solution (GoDaddy). This method is the most complex, and can take up to 5-10 days to give us access to your Domain Control Panel. </p>

                <h4>Domain Name Forwarding</h4>
                <p>We also offer Domain or URL Forwarding facility which allows you to redirect / point your other Domain Names that you may have to your new Website’s Domain Name or URL. Domain Forwarding is a technique on the World Wide Web for making your Branded Website available under many Domain Names. It is also known as Domain / URL Redirection. Domain Forwarding allows you to point any other Domain Names to your Primary Domain Name or URL. </p>
                <p>Domain / URL Forwarding are useful in the following cases:</p>

                <h4>1. Moving An Old Domain To A New Domain </h4>
                <p>
                    You want to move or redirect your existing website from an old Domain / URL to another existing or new Domain / URL.<br>
                    For example: <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.oldjewelers.com</a> >>> <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.newjewelers.com</a>
                </p>

                <h4>2. Easy-To-Remember Domain Name</h4>
                <p>
                    You have a website built elsewhere and you want to give people an easy-to-remember domain name to reach your site.<br>
                    For example: <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.easyjewelers.com</a> >>> <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.difficultname2remeberjewelers.com</a> So when users type <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.easyjewelers.com</a> in their browsers, they will be automatically forwarded to <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.difficultname2remeberjewelers.com</a>
                </p>

                <h4>3. Misspellings</h4>
                <p>A web browser user might mistype a URL. <br>For example: <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usjewelry.com</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewlery.com</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewlry.com</a> etc... <br>Businesses often register these misspelled domains and re-direct them to their correct location: <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewelry.com</a></p>

                <h4>4. Related Words </h4>
                <p>A user might type related URL. Organizations often register these ‘related’ domains and re-direct them to their main domain. <br>For example: the <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewelry.net</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewelry.biz</a> could both redirect users to a single domain: <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.usajewelry.com</a></p>
