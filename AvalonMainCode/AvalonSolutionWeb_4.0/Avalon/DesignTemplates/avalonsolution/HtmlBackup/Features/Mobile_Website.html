                <h4>Why Do you Need a Mobile Ready Website?</h4>
                <p>Mobile web browsing is gaining popularity and acceptance at an incredible rate. Everyday more and more people are using their SmartPhones and other devices to access the internet. Mobile marketing offers a huge opportunity for businesses to reach and retain customers at very little cost. As a result it is becoming more and more important to offer a mobile-friendly alternative to your current website. According to a latest report from Forrester Research, Mobile Commerce will reach $10 billion by the end of 2012 and $31 billion by 2016. Amazon’s worldwide mobile commerce sales in the 2011 topped $1.5 billion. There are currently 40 million mobile users in the USA and Gartner the IT research firm are predicting that mobile browsing will overtake desktop browsing by 2013. To reach this growing number of mobile users it is vital to have a mobile ready website. </p>
                <p>Everyone is using their SmartPhones and mobile phones to search best deals, fantastic products and businesses, so your website must be mobile ready to remain competitive. Consumers have a real relationship with their mobile phones and now it’s time for you to develop a marketing strategy to take advantage of this exploding business opportunity. It is not sufficient to simply create a miniature version of your website because people don’t relate to their mobile phones in the same way they relate to their laptops or desktop computers. Furthermore accessing desktop websites from a mobile phone is often slow and frustrating, because desktop websites are not designed for SmartPhones.</p>
