                <h4>What is Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?</h4>
                <p>The purpose of ADA is to make sure that people with disabilities should have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. ADA states equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, employment, transportation, state and local government services and telecommunications.</p>

                <h4>Why Should Websites Be Accessible?</h4>
                <p>Web Accessibility means that website should provide the way so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web.</p>
                <p>We respect the civil rights of every person and every website should have accessible features for people with disabilities.</p>
