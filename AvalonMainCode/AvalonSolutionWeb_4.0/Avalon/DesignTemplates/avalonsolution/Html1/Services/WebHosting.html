                <p>Web hosting allows you to display your website to customers all over the world on internet. We, as website hosting provider, store your site on our servers and give it a unique address (DNS) through which people anywhere in the world can find, open, and interact with your site. In simple term, when we create and host your website, we basically buy space to keep your website files on a server. </p>
